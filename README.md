## This repository contains a SQL project that focuses on exploring and analyzing Covid-19 data. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Our World in Data.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to gain insights from the Covid-19 dataset through data exploration and analysis using SQL. The project is divided into three main steps:
- exploring and understanding the dataset
- data cleaning
- analyzing the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Our World in Data. It provides information on Covid-19 deaths, including variables such as:
- date 
- location
- total deaths and more. The dataset is in a structured format, suitable for SQL analysis.

## Project Steps
- Exploring and Understanding Dataset:
Take time to familiarize yourself with the dataset structure, available variables, and their meanings.
Identify any missing values, inconsistencies, or data quality issues that may need to be addressed during the cleaning phase.

- Data Cleaning:
Perform necessary data cleaning steps to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
Handle missing values, address inconsistencies, and standardize data formats if required.
Document the cleaning steps taken to maintain transparency and reproducibility.

- Analyzing Data:
Formulate specific research questions or areas of interest related to Covid-19 data.
Write SQL queries to extract relevant information and perform necessary calculations.
Analyze trends, patterns, and relationships within the data to gain insights.
Visualize the results using appropriate charts, graphs, or other visual representations, if desired.
